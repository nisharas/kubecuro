**1. The "Open Core" Commitment**

We are committed to maintaining a powerful, free, and open-source core.

The "Core" (Always Apache-2.0): Basic YAML healing, standard K8s logic checks (Service-to-Pod, Port alignment, API deprecations), and the CLI framework will remain open-source forever.

The "Plus" (Commercial): Features designed for large-scale corporate environments (e.g., SOC2 compliance reporting, multi-cluster management, and SSO integration) may be offered under a commercial license to fund the project's development.

**2. The "Sustainability" Rule**

To ensure Nishar A Sunkesala and future maintainers can work on KubeCuro full-time:

We may prioritize "Monetized Issues" (Bounties) for specific feature requests.

We use a Contribution Grant (in CONTRIBUTING.md) to allow the project to evolve its business model without legal gridlock.

**3. Decision Making**

Currently, the project follows the Benevolent Dictator for Life (BDFL) model.

Maintainer: Nishar A Sunkesala has final say on all architectural changes and license decisions.

Community Input: Major changes will be proposed via GitHub Discussions to gather feedback before implementation.
